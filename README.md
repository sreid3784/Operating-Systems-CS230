1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
    <Gaming Room app "Draw It or Lose It!" was a mobile friendly and web based application that aimed to re-create the fun and enjoyment of pictionary combined with the attributes of a once popular 1980's gameshow.>
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
<Requirements were clear and easy to understand. We gave protential hardships but offered good solutions around them. We gave a fact based reccommendation based on their primary constraints of cost and multi port deployments. >

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
<It helped make sure you knew what you were saying was a good idea. It forced you to think about all of the components of a web based applition such as API functionality, memory management, and security. >

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
< I would like to expand more on advantages and disadvantages of having a multi port application. I'd like to know more about what makes going from system to system difficult or easy. Are there tools already out there that have solved this problem already?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<You want to make sure you're designing what they want. Ultimately it is their product so if they give you constraints or requirments you need to build them in. Often times this is the expectation of their business. Additionally, they know their customers and are designing an experience they know they will enjoy. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
<I would love to focus more on the development of the application. More focus on coding and what resources are out in the field today that can help speed up and assist with development.
